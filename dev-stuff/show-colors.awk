# DESCRIPTION
#   Generates a neat looking heatmap of the bed mesh from Klippers API output.
#   This works by using the full width half block unicode character (â–„) to compine
#   two rows into a single row. Row #0 will be iterated over, saving the colors and 
#   data to an array, then as row #1 is processed, the half-block character will use
#   the color meant for row #0 as the background (top) color and the the color for 
#   row #2 on the bottom.
#   This does result in a much smaller mesh display which can be enlarged a bit by
#   inserting "synthetic" columns and rows inbetween each row/column, then averaging
#   the values on either side of the cell as they're being processed.
#
# TODO
#   Currently this works for a 12/12 bed mesh, but it should be written so it'll
#   work with any mesh size. The X/Y indicators, arrows and gradient scale on the
#   right will probably be broken on different bed mesh scales.
